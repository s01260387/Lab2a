Lab2a

## Executive Summary
Summarize this assignment and the goal of this lab
learn the difference between place values of computers and the hardware of computers
## Hardware
# Hard Drives and Memory
What is the difference between latency and transfer rates in the performance of a hard drive?
latency is how much time it takes for an input on a computer to take effect. transfer rates is how much data is trnafering, not time
How a solid state (SSD) hard drive is different from a traditional hard drive?
there are no moving parts in ssd
Why does increasing RAM make the computer run faster?
theres less data to swap between applications
What is the difference between 64 and 32 bit data paths?
32 bit can process only 4 gigabytes while 64 can process 184 gb
# ALU and Control Unit
Explain the interaction of the control unit and ALU in the CPU
the control unit tells the alu what to do and the alu stores the output register
# CPU, Input and Output
Identify how the example addresses each of the components: CPU, Input and Output
## Data Representation
# Numeric Conversions
Explain the difference between decimal, binary and hexadecimal numbers
decimal is base 10
binary is base 2
hexa is base 16
Convert the decimal number 211 to binary showing your work (be sure to include your name in your screenshot or scanned file)
11011101
Convert the binary number 101101010 to decimal (show your work)
362
Convert the decimal number 192 to hexadecimal (show your work)
0xC0
## Conclusion
Reflect on what you have learnt from this week
I learned about computer hardware, cpu, conversions, and control units and ALU
